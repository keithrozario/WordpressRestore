+Need to add the following block to the apache .conf file, if creating from scratch, to enable permalinks:
  	<Directory /var/www>
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        allow from all
       </Directory>

[side note] the older .htaccess file in production still has older W3 Cache rewrite rules--remove them
[side note] wp-login.php forces to ssl (in wp-login.php script itself)--you'll need to enable ssl if you want to logon

Almost there--as always! :)

Testing:
-So far testing only on DigitalOcean Ubuntu Image, test with Amazon AMI's as well
-The Goal is to keep this standardize to Ubuntu 16.04 (only!!), but have it work across every Ubuntu image (AWS, LINODE and Digital Ocean)
